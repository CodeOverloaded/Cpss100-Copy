			CPSS100 Redesign Prototype Project <br>
			Supa Powered Sports Bros: Michael Li, Connor Pucci, Andros Yang, Arden Zhang <br><br>
			Our Redesign Prototype Project focused on helping students study better in the McKeldin Library study rooms, focusing on the issue that sound from one study room can be heard in adjacent study rooms. The webapp prototype is designed to monitor the volume around the microphone that the webapp is using (the laptop for this demo). If the sound volume passes a designated threshold, the webapp will display a message saying that it is too loud. The volume bar in the webapp is used to gauge the loudness around the microphone (green if it's in an acceptable range, red if it's too loud). Putting it into practical use for students using the Mckeldin Library study rooms, the students can open the webapp on their laptops or phones and periodically check their volume; however, if they are too loud, a notification will pop up saying that they are being disruptive to their peers in the other study rooms.<br><br>
			Test the webapp yourself. Talk amongst your peers around you and see how the volume gauge responds.
